The appy Prince” is a story that explores compassion in society,
serving as a fairy tale and a fable at once. It’s about a prince who 
is only allowed to see beauty and comfort in his life. When he dies,
he’s turned into a golden statue in his city, where he discovers that 
others actually live their lives in poverty and darkness. With the help of 
a swallow (a type of bird), the prince manages to help people even after
death.Since the story is old, much of the English is outdated (not used in
modern English). Still, if you have a good grasp of the English language, 
you can use this story to give yourself a great reading challenge.
